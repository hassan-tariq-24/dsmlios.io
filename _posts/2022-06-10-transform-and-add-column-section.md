There is major difference between two sections of PowerBI. The Transform Column is widely used in order to alter the original data. Where as the Add Column might do almost the same tasks as Transform but the major difference is the addition of new column.  

It perfroms the same task but it just takes the operations and add new column of results. It might be safe thing to do but in later cases when the data is too latge it might be a bit problem.

So, it depends upon case to case if you really need to modify the existing data or if you want to play safe you can always go and add new column with defined tasks performed or it is always better to stay safe.

I hope you like the post, I will surely expalin more complex features of this tool that can help geenrate more productivity for the reader.
