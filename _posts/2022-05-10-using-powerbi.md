I'm using PowerBI since couple of months now. I can assure the Productivity I have optained is really good. As of Magic QC ranking PowerBI is still the Number 1 tool for Bussiness Intelligence reporting and used all over the world. Enlisted below I'm going to share some prepositions why to use PowerBI for your bussness reporting pipelines.

2) It really helps in building Relational Models to blend data from multiple sources. This provides the user with the holoistic power of creating table relationships and perform data modeling accross all data.
