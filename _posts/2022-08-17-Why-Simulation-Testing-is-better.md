Testing is one of the greatest activities Engineers can perform in order to see the results of their work. 

Achieving autonomous driving would not be feasible without simulation.

But simulation has even more advantages:
Physical testing on proving grounds
• needs test drivers
• needs test vehicles
• needs large areas dedicated as proving grounds
• relies on weather conditions for certain use cases
• is expensive
On the other hand, virtual testing in simulations
• enables parallel testing
• creates scenarios that focus on the test objectives
• enables to perform more tests in the same amount of time
• enables to replicate tests
• helps to define the test focus for physical test sites
(HIL, VIL, proving ground)
